# Document_classification
I did this document_classification project for Natural Language Processing subject when I studied at Ajou University in Korea.
The purpose of the project is to check the performance of three different machine-learning classifier algorithms using an adult dataset.
I used three common algorithms: 1)	Gaussian naive Bayes
                                2)	Bernoulli naive Bayes 
                                3)	Multinomial naive Bayes.
I compared their performance and visualize it in order to make it easy to notice the difference.
All codes and detailed descriptions are shown and explained step by step in the "NLP_Project.docx" file.
